# Prompt Engine Project Overview

## Architecture

The project follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Core Modules
- `promptEnhancer.js`: Core prompt enhancement logic with medium-specific optimizations
- `promptTypes.js`: Defines different prompt types, mediums, and their configurations
- `promptValidator.js`: Validates prompts against defined rules and best practices
- `bestPractices.js`: Defines enhancement rules and common improvements

### Feature Modules
- `darkMode.js`: Handles dark mode functionality and system preferences
- `savedPrompts.js`: Manages saving, loading, and categorizing prompts
- `shareFeatures.js`: Handles sharing functionality with multiple platforms
- `uiFeatures.js`: Core UI utilities and feature aggregation

### Main Application
- `main.js`: Main application logic and UI interactions
- `index.html`: Main application interface with semantic structure
- `styles.css`: Application styling with responsive design
- `footer.html`: Footer component with branding and social links
